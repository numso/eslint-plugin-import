# eslint-plugin-import

This is a fork of [Ben Mosher's fantastic plugin](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import). You probably want to install that one instead.

We loved what the library gave us, but we wanted more granular sorting of our imports. We also needed --fix to work with this sorting because of the size of our project. The changes we made work for our project, but we hard coded some of the eslint flags. Also, the changes haven't been tested very thoroughly... Hopefully one day we'll have time to do a proper PR back into the main library.
